# sdl-iso-project

this is a hobby project which started as an idea for efficiently rendering Gnomoria/Ingnomia inspired isometric voxels, and has become a programming sandbox with goals to turn it into a fully-fledged indie game. notably in comparison, it is fully 3d and real-time and supports custom collision and free movement.

check out the wiki (WIP) for info on (some) of the fun stuff I've implemented to make this thing work.
