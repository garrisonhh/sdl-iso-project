isometric graphics with c and sdl

## TODOs
1) block updates; minimizing exposeMask checks
	- transparent blocks; blocks that don't block exposure
2) entity\_t
	- sprite rendering
	- collision (stick to cubes for now at least)
3) basic gameplay elements
	- player entity with controls and camera movement
	- simple procedural world with some value noise and maybe structures/foliage or smth
