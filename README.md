isometric graphics with c and sdl

## TODOs
1) better blocks
	- minimizing exposure checks
	- more versatile textures
		- transparent blocks; blocks that don't block exposure
2) entity\_t
	- sprite rendering
	- collision (stick to cubes for now at least)
3) basic gameplay elements
	- player entity with controls and camera movement
	- simple procedural world with some ~~value~~ perlin noise and maybe structures/foliage or smth
